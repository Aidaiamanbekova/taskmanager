# Task Management System

## Overview

 Task Management System is designed to facilitate efficient project development and task organization. It incorporates both code management using version control and task tracking to streamline collaborative work within a team.

## Features

### Version Control (Git)

- Repository Setup:
  - Initialize and configure Git repositories for your projects.
  - Manage branches for different features or development stages.

- Collaborative Workflow:
  - Enable multiple developers to work concurrently on the same project.
  - Merge changes seamlessly to maintain a consistent codebase.

- History Tracking:
  - Keep a comprehensive history of code changes with commit messages.
  - Rollback to previous versions if needed.

### Task Management

- Task Creation:
  - Create tasks for different project requirements, bug fixes, or features.
  - Include task details, priority, and assigned team members.

- Task Assignment:
  - Assign tasks to team members based on their expertise.
  - Distribute workload evenly among the team.

- Progress Tracking:
  - Monitor the progress of each task.
  - Update task status (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed).

- Task Dependencies:
  - Define task dependencies to ensure a logical sequence of work.
  - Visualize dependencies to plan and execute tasks effectively.


### Usage

1. Code Management:
   - Make changes to the codebase in feature branches.
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages.
   - Merge branches using pull requests or merge requests.

2. Task Management:
   - Create tasks for new features, bug fixes, or improvements.
   - Assign tasks to team members.
   - Update task status as work progresses.

3. Collaboration:
   - Communicate with team members through integrated communication channels.
   - Discuss code changes and task details.

4. Continuous Integration (Optional):
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b feature-name.
3. Commit your changes: git commit -m 'Add new feature'.
4. Push to the branch: git push origin feature-name.
5. Submit a pull request.
